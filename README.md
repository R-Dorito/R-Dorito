- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @R-Dorito
I am interested in learning programming to one day become an automation/controls system engineer.
I have had experience working with a wide range of different languages, but my favourite languages at the moment is React.js (for how easy and fun it is as an artistic outlet) and Python (for how logical and similar to MATLAB it is). A lot of these projects below are just test projects and experimental programs, for fun.
